# CS648_Assignment_1 - Avocado Land - Jacob Byerline

Our mission here at **Avocado Land** is to use modern technology to give dogs the treats they deserve 
in the most elegant and pet-friendly manner. 

## Our Website

Our website is made up of stunning visuals using the most recent HTML technologies and concepts from 1993.

*"You'd be hard-pressed to find a better looking website"* - Jacob Byerline

Our website features the following:
- Header tags ```<h1></h1>```
- Paragraph tags```<p></p>```
- Break tags```</br>```

(As well as the pre inserted "high-level" meta and title tags!!!)
